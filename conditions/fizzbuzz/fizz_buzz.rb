# Write a method fizz_buzz which takes a number as an argument

# it returns an array of number elements from 1 to number, but replaces some of them according to these rules:

# 1. If the number is divisible by 3, then replace it by 'Fizz'
# 2. If the number is divisible by 5, then replace it by 'Buzz'
# 3. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then replace it by 'FizzBuzz'

def fizz_buzz(number)
  # TODO:
end
