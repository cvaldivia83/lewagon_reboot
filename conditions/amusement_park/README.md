## Amusement Park

Today we are working in an amusement park.

Before one of our dear attendees step inside a ride we need to check 2 things:

- if the attendee has a ride pass
- if the attendee's height is bigger than the minimum required

On our park, the minimum required height is 140cm.

If the attendee has a pass and is taller than 140cm return true

Otherwise, return false.
