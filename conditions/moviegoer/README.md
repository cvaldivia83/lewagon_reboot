## Moviegoer

In this exercise you will build out rules for a movie theater's website.

1. Check if a moviegoer is entitled to the seniors' discount.

The theatre offers a discount for "old-age-pensions". Anyone who is 60 or older pays 10 for a ticket. Anyone younger pays the full 15.

Write the #ticket_price method using a ternary statement.
