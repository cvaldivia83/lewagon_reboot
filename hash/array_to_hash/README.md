## Hash

Think of hashes like a dictionnaire: we have a key and on the other side we have a value.

```
  hash = { school: "Le Wagon", city: "Rio de Janeiro", subject: "web-development" }
```

Most commonly, a hash is created using symbols as keys and any data types as values. All key-value pairs in a hash are surrounded by curly braces {} and comma separated.
