## Lasagna

In this exercise you're going to write some code to help you cook a brilliant lasagna from your favorite cooking book.

You have four tasks, all related to the time spent cooking the lasagna.

1. Create a Lasagna Class.

We need to save some characteristics about our lasagna:

1.1 Flavor - should be a String
1.2 Ingredients - should be an Array of Strings
1.3 Prep Time - should be an Integer (minutes)
1.4 Cooking Time = should be an Integer (minutes)

2. Return how many minutes the lasagna should stay in the oven

Define the Lasagna#expected_minutes_in_oven method that returns how many minutes the lasagna should be in the oven.

3. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

Define the Lasagna#remaining_minutes_in_oven method that takes the actual minutes the lasagna has been in the oven as a parameter and returns how many minutes the lasagna still has to remain in the oven.

4. Calculate the total time you need to spend cooking the lasagna.

Define a Lasagna#total_time that calculates the total time a person needs to cook the lasagna.
